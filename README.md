## Important note on unlocking the VBA project of macro files

Upon unlocking the VBA Project of a Macro Enabled file, that file will state it has encountered issues and needs to recover... __DO NOT PANIC__, this is normal.

The steps to follow to complete the unlock is as follows:

1. Open the unlocked file and click 'Enable Content' on the warning:

2. Click 'OK' on the following pop-up:

3. Open Visual Basic from the Developer toolbar:

5. Navigate to the Protection tab and enter a new password (a one character password is fine, as we will be removing it again straight away). Click 'OK'.

6. Head back in to VBAProject Properties > Protection tab, and de-select the 'Lock project for viewing' checkbox and clear any passwords in the boxes below. Click 'OK'.

7. The modules will now be unlocked and you can save the document without having to repeat these steps.
